\chapter{Comparisons with other instruments}
\label{chapter:comparisons}
This chapter contains comparisons between the Level2 data products of \smr\ and
collocated measurements from various instruments. The comparisons are organised
primarily on frequency mode, secondarily on data product. For each product,
average deviations from the various instruments at different altitudes are
investigated, followed by an investigation of the over-all correlation between
the measurements and both \smr~v2 and~v3. The \smr\ measurement response and
averaging kernels are also investigated for each data product.

From the correlation some key performance indicators are obtained and presented
in a table. Of these the most important are the \emph{Pearson correlation} and
\emph{slope}, both of which should be as close as possible to unity for a good
match, and the \emph{intercept}, which should ideally be zero.
