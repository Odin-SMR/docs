\section{Aim and scope of this document}
\label{sec:aim}
\smr\ performs passive limb measurements of the atmosphere,
mainly at wavelengths and frequencies around 0.6\,mm and 500\,GHz,
respectively.
From these measurements, profiles of 
\chem{O_3}, \chem{ClO}, \chem{N_{2}O}, \chem{HNO_{3}}, 
\chem{H_{2}O}, \chem{CO}, and isotopologues of \chem{H_{2}O}, and \chem{O_{3}},
that are species that are of interest for studying stratospheric and 
mesospheric chemistry and dynamics, can be derived. 
\smr\ has been in operation for approximately 14 years, and thus, the Level2
dataset can potentially be applied for scientifically interesting trend analysis.

A new \smr\ Level2 product dataset will be generated, and this dataset will be based
on updated/revised processing algorithms and input data.
A verification dataset (VDS) will be used as a tool to verify the new 
processing system/Level2 products.

The aim of this document is to describe this VDS.
This VDS is a representative subset of the \smr\ Level1B dataset
and collocated correlative measurements from similar
instruments, i.e. Level2 data from Odin/OSIRIS, Aura/MLS, ENVISAT/MIPAS,
ISS/JEM/SMILES, and Meteor3M/SAGEIII.   


\section{Document structure}

This document is organized as follows:
Chapter 2 describes the \smr\ Level2 data products.
Chapter 3 describes the correlative datasets
included in the VDS, and how the VDS was constructed.
Chapter 4 describes an API to the VDS.
