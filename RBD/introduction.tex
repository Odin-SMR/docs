Text from workpackage description\\
The first task is to define the level2 product(s) to be generated,
and then establish a structured set of individual high-level requirements for
\begin{itemize}
\item the product(s) to be generated,
\item the algorithms to be implemented either in the form of refinements to existing
  algorithms or as newly developed alternative algorithms
\item all input data (i.e. EO and ancillary data) required to generate the data product(s),
\item methods, test areas, and in-situ observation data sources to be used to validate the products
\end{itemize}

The RB shall consolidate and refine the requirements listed in the SOW
and those already identified in the proposal.
