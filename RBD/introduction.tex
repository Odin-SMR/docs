\section{Aim and scope of this document}
\label{sec:aim}
\smr\ performs passive limb measurements of the atmosphere,
mainly at wavelengths / frequencies around 0.6\,mm / 500\,GHz,
From these measurements, profiles of 
\chem{O_3}, \chem{ClO}, \chem{N_{2}O}, \chem{HNO_{3}}, 
\chem{H_{2}O}, \chem{CO}, and isotopologues of \chem{H_{2}O}, and \chem{O_{3}},
which are species that are of interest for studying stratospheric and 
mesospheric chemistry and dynamics, can be derived. 

The aim of this document is to define \smr\ Level2 products
to be generated, and then establish a structured set of 
individual high-level requirements for
\begin{itemize}
\item the product(s) to be generated,
\item the algorithms to be implemented either in the form of refinements to existing
  algorithms or as newly developed alternative algorithms
\item all input data (i.e. EO and ancillary data) required to generate the data product(s),
\item methods, test areas, and in-situ observation data sources to be used to validate the products
\end{itemize}

\section{Document structure}
  
This document is organised as following:
Chapter 2 describes the \smr\ Level2 data products.
Chapter 3 describes the requirements for
the \smr Level2 algorithms and input data.
Chapter 4 describes requirements for validation
of \smr data products.
