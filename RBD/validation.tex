\chapter{Data validation}


\section{Validation objective and method}
Validation is an iterative process: validation results are used to trace
systematic errors in the instrument and its operational algorithms and thus 
to improve Level1 and Level2 products.

\lcomment{BR}{Describe the validation method we intend to apply?}

\section{Level1B verification}

Radiances compared with radiative transfer model spectra.
\lcomment{BR}{Expand on this.}

\section{Level2 validation}

Compare species (\chem{O_3}, \chem{ClO}, \chem{N_{2}O}, \chem{HNO_{3}})
retrieved from stratospheric mode 
observations to the previous Odin-SMR level 2 version, 
and to correlative datasets (Envisat/MIPAS and Aura/MLS).

A basic requirement is that external data intended to be used 
for validation is validated.
 

\lcomment{BR}{Describe which data sources / requirements we intend to use for
validation purposes?}
