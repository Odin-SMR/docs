The Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR), aboard the Odin satellite, has been in operation
since 2001 and performs passive limb measurements of the atmosphere, mainly at 
frequencies around 500\,GHz. From these measurements, profiles of species that are of
interest for studying stratospheric and mesospheric chemistry and dynamics can be
derived, such as \chem{O_3}, \chem{ClO}, \chem{N_{2}O}, \chem{NO}, \chem{HNO_{3}},
\chem{H_{2}O}, \chem{CO}, and isotopologues of \chem{H_{2}O}, and \chem{O_{3}}.
These profiles are referred to as Level2 (L2) products of \smr. They are generated by
a Level2 processor. The input to the Level2 processor is geolocated and calibrated
measurements (\smr\ Level1B data, described in \citet{atbdl1b}) and dynamic and
static auxilliary/ancilliary data.

The aim of this document is to provide an user-friendly description of the L2 data.
More details about the L2 processing system and the algorithms applied by the L2
processor are available in the Input/Output Data Definition Document (IODD) \citep{iodd}
and in the Algorithms Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) - Level 2 processing \citep{atbdl2},
respectively.
