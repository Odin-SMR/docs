\section{Aim and scope of this document}
\label{sec:aim}
\smr\ performs passive limb measurements of the atmosphere,
mainly at wavelengths and frequencies around 0.6\,mm and 500\,GHz,
respectively.
From these measurements, profiles of 
\chem{O_3}, \chem{ClO}, \chem{N_{2}O}, \chem{HNO_{3}}, 
\chem{H_{2}O}, \chem{CO}, and isotopologues of \chem{H_{2}O}, and \chem{O_{3}},
that are species that are of interest for studying stratospheric and 
mesospheric chemistry and dynamics, can be derived. 
\smr\ has been in operation for approximately 18 years, and thus, the Level2
dataset can potentially be applied for scientifically interesting trend analysis.

A new \smr\ Level2 product dataset (version 3.0.0, see \cite{pver}) has been generated, and
this document presents a completeness analysis of this dataset. A completeness analysis
is typically a description of how many scans that have been measured
and successfully processed during the complete mission.

\section{Document structure}

Chapter 2 describes the \smr\ Level2 data products,
and Chapter 3 describes the completeness analysis.
