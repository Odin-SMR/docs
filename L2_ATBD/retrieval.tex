\chapter{Retrieval  variables}
\label{chapter:retvars}

This chapter reviews the variables that are part of the retrievals, either
directly or indirectly. The presentation follows the formalism presented in
Sec.~\ref{sec:formalism}.


\section{Basic variable choices}
\label{sec:retr:basics}
%
\smr\ performs measurements in several frequency bands simultaneously
(Sec.~\ref{sec:smr:details}). The set of frequency bands differs between
observation modes \citep{atbdl1b}. The altitude range scanned by \smr\ is not
fixed, and a \smr\ limb ``scan'' is simply defined as the spectra recorded
between two adjacent turning points, in altitude, of the limb scanning
\citep{atbdl1b}. The retrievals covered by this \ATBD\ operate only on one
scan, from a single frequency band, at the time. Each combination of scan and
frequency band is treated separately, no information is carried between
different retrievals.

Following the discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec:setup:inverse:xb}, the state vector
does not only contain the quantities targeted directly by the \smr\
measurements, that is, gas species concentrations and atmospheric temperatures,
but also a number of other variables are part of \SttVct\ (Sec.~\ref{sec:x}).
These variables are either instrument correction factors or describe some
interfering atmospheric effect. However, a restriction to effects of random
nature is made, no fixed forward model variables (such as spectroscopic data)
are placed in \SttVct. That is, variables causing systematic retrieval errors
are not included in \SttVct\ (and neither in \aCvrMtr{o}, Sec.~\ref{sec:So}).

Covariance matrices are implemented as sparse matrices, while all other
variables are stored as full vectors or matrices. For the retrieval problem at
hand, $\aWfnMtr{\SttVct}$ is relatively dense and the overhead related with
a sparse representation results in better performance keeping
$\aWfnMtr{\SttVct}$ as a full matrix.



\section{The measurement vector, \MsrVct}
\label{sec:y}
%
The measurement vector contains solely \smr\ brightness temperature values,
with spectra from different tangent altitudes appended. That is,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:y}
  \MsrVct =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \MsrVct_1\\ 
    \MsrVct_2\\ 
    \vdots\\ 
    \MsrVct_s
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\MsrVct_1$/$\MsrVct_s$ is the spectrum from the highest/lowest tangent
altitude etc. 

Each retrieval only contains data from a single scan, as mentioned, but all
spectra of the scan are not included. For each mode an upper and lower tangent
altitude limit are defined, that determine which spectra of a scan that will be
part of \MsrVct. The altitude limits are defined using geometrical tangent
altitudes (that is, refraction neglected) as those are the tangent altitudes
found in the L1b data. A minimum scan range is defined in the same manner; no
retrieval is made if a limb scan does not cover this minimum range. 



\section{Observation uncertainty covariance matrix, \aCvrMtr{o}}
\label{sec:So}
%
All variables of random nature that have a significant impact on the
measurements, including indirect effects through the forward model, are part of
the state vector (Secs.~\ref{sec:retr:basics} and \ref{sec:x}). This means that
the term $\aWfnMtr{\FrwMdlVct}\aCvrMtr{\FrwMdlVct} \aWfnMtr{\FrwMdlVct}^T$ in
Eq.~\ref{eq:So} should give a relatively small contribution (ignoring
systematic components) to $\aCvrMtr{\MsrErrVct_o}$. Accordingly, \aCvrMtr{o} is
set to only represent thermal noise:
\begin{equation}
  \aCvrMtr{o} = \aCvrMtr{\MsrErrVct_n}.
\end{equation}
The standard deviations to include in $\aCvrMtr{\MsrErrVct_n}$ are set
according to \citet{atbdl1b}. The correlation of noise between adjecent
channels of each spectrum is considered. The magnitude of this correlation
depends on if a Hanning window has been applied or not. No noise correlation
between spectra from different altitudes is included.


\section{The state vector, \SttVct}
\label{sec:x}
%
The state vector contains a mix of quantities (Sec.~\ref{sec:retr:basics}).
Besides the 118\,GHz band, the quantities always present are: gas species
profiles $(\VctStl{v})$, the temperature profile $(\VctStl{t})$, a set of
brightness temperature off-sets $(\Delta\VctStl{o})$, a pointing off-set
$(\Delta\theta)$ and a frequency off-set $(\Delta\nu)$. With
just these quantities retrieved, and a case involving two gas species, the
state vector becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:x:example}
  \SttVct =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \VctStl{v}_1\\ 
    \VctStl{v}_2\\ 
    \VctStl{t}\\ 
    \VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}}\\ 
    \Delta\theta\\ 
    \Delta\nu 
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
For 118\,GHz the state vector contains no species profiles as only oxygen,
having a known VMR, has to be considered for this frequency band.

A species or temperature ``profile'' is a set of values describing the vertical
variation, at a set of specified pressures, that is, the retrieval grid (see
also Sec.~\ref{sec:arts:aspects}). Atmospheric temperatures are in Kelvin. Gas
species are reported as \VMR, but the actual retrieval is internally performed
using one of the two following units:
\begin{itemize}
\item Default is to operate with the relative value with respect to a priori.
  In this ``relative unit'' a priori matches a value of 1.
\item A constrain of ensuring positive VMR values is achieved by instead
  retrievaing the natural logarithm of the unit above. Using this unit, the a
  priori state corresponds to a vector of zeros.
\end{itemize}
Proper rescalings of the state vector and the weighting function matrix are
performed, following the retrieval unit applied.


As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:smr:errors}, there is not a perfect compensation
for gain variations, causing an off-set in brightness temperatures. This
off-set has been found to be flat over the frequency bands, but differ from one
tangent altitude to next. The vector \VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}} contains one
brightness temperature off-set for each included spectrum, to compensate for
the ``baseline shift''. That is, a correction for the brightness temperatures is
estimated, and corrected spectra can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:retr:baseline}
  \hat{T}_b^{ij} = T_b^{ij} + \Delta\VctStl{o}_i
\end{equation}
where $T_b^{ij}$ is brightness temperature of channel $j$ and tangent altitude
$i$ and $\Delta\VctStl{o}_i$ is element $i$ of $\Delta\VctStl{o}$.

The pointing and frequency off-sets are scalar values. This implies that these
correction factors are valid for the complete scan. In \ARTS\ the viewing
direction, of each \LOS, is specified as the angle from zenith. These angles
cannot be determined perfectly from attitude data, but the error has been
judged to be constant during a scan and a single correction value should be
sufficient. Hence, the retrieved zenith angles are
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:retr:point}
  \hat{\theta_i} = \theta_i + \Delta\theta,  
\end{equation}
where $\theta_i$ is the L1b zenith angle of tangent altitude $i$. A positive 
$\Delta\theta$ means that the retrieval estimated lower tangent altitudes than
obtained by the attitude data. As a rule of thumb, $\Delta\theta=\pm0.01\degree$
matches about $\mp550$\,m in tangent altitude.

There is a similar uncertainty in the exact frequencies observed. This
uncertainty originates in the \LO-signal. Already pre-launch tests showed that
\LO-frequencies vary somewhat with temperature. A correction table was created,
but some frequency error remains and there seems also to be some ageing on the
\LO-chain affecting final frequencies. The resulting frequency uncertainty is
totally correlated between the backend channels inside each frequency band. As
long as the \LO-signal is phase-locked, it is judged that the frequency off-set
is constant during a limb scan. However, the phase-locking of the
575\,GHz front-end has been failing basically throughout the mission, and the
assumption of a constant frequency off-set is more uncertain for this receiver
chain. The switch from version 1 to 2 of \ARTS\ enables the retrieval of a
non-constant frequency off-set, but this possibility will only be activated later
if found necessary. The retrieved frequency of channel $i$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:retr:freq}
  \hat{\nu_j} = \nu_j + \Delta\nu,  
\end{equation}
where $\nu_j$ is the frequency found given by L1b data.


\section{A priori uncertainty covariance matrix, \aCvrMtr{a}}
\label{sec:Sa}
%
The setting of \aCvrMtr{a}\ is the most controversial part of \OEM, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:setup:inverse:xb} for some comments. This subject is not
elaborated further, it is just noticed that for VMR and atmospheric
temperature, in general, there exist no direct measurements on which total
covariance matrices can be based and ad hoc values are applied to a large
extent. In addition, the values selected results in that \aCvrMtr{a}\ in
general should over-estimate variability. Accordingly, \OEM\ is not used in a
strict sense, but the retrievals can still be classified is regularisation
\citep{ungermann2011tomographic} and close to optimal result should be obtained
as long as \aCvrMtr{a}\ is given ``reasonable'' values
\citep{eriksson:analy:00}. On the other hand, the uncertainties in the
instrumental variables are known fairly well and the corresponding parts of
\aCvrMtr{a}\ should be quite accurate.

The atmosphere exhibits vertical correlation, see \citet{eriksson:stati:02} for
examples on ozone and temperature correlations. In lack of direct measurements
covering all altitudes, vertical correlations are modelled by parametric
expressions, using a correlation length $l_c$. The correlation is modelled to
follow a Gaussian function,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:corr:gau}
  \rho(z_1,z_2) = exp\left(-4[(z_1-z_2)/(l_c(z_1)+l_c(z_2))]^2\right),
\end{equation}
or an exponential one,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:corr:exp}
  \rho(z_1,z_2) = exp\left(-2\left|z_1-z_2\right|/(l_c(z_1)+l_c(z_2))\right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho(z_1,z_2)$ is the correlation coefficient between altitudes $z_1$
and $z_2$. Note that the mean of the correlation length at $z_1$ and $z_2$ is
used, that is,  $l_c(z_1)/2+l_c(z_2)/2$.

The frequency and pointing off-sets are scalar values, and only a standard
deviation ($\sigma$) for each quantity must be specified. The brightness
temperature off-sets have been found to be uncorrelated between spectra, and
the variation to have no variation with altitude. This results in that the
covariance matrix for $\VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}}$ can be written as
$\sigma_{\VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}}}^2\IdnMtr$.

Any correlations between the different quantities in \SttVct\ are fully
ignored. That is, the total covariance matrix becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sa}
  \aCvrMtr{a} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{v}_1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{v}_2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{t}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}}}^2\IdnMtr & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\Delta\theta}^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\Delta\nu}^2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The inverse of a block-diagonal matrix of this type is also a block-diagonal
matrix, consisting of the inverse of the individual matrices, and the inverse
of \aCvrMtr{a}\ is calculated in the following manner:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sainv}
  \aCvrMtr{a}^{-1} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{v}_1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{v}_2}^{-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \aCvrMtr{\VctStl{t}}^{-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\VctStl{\Delta\VctStl{o}}}^{-2}\IdnMtr & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\Delta\theta}^{-2} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{\Delta\nu}^{-2} \\
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
