\section{General features}
\label{sec:arts:features}

\subsection{Main features}
%
\ARTS, the Atmospheric radiative transfer simulator, is a publicly available
software that is both developed and maintained as an open source project. The
software was initiated 1999, and the first official version was released some
years later \citep{buehler:artst:05}. The main novelty of this version was the
fact that \ARTS\ behaves more or less as a scripting language, in contrast to
most other forward models that are controlled by fixed set of keywords. The
control file was introduced to meet the design goal of high modularity. When
defining a \ARTS\ control file, the user can select between a high number of
workspace methods and variables. Regarding physical mechanisms covered, \ARTS\
v1 did not stand out in any way, but despite this the software found a number
of applications, including operational \SMR\ processing
(Sec.~\ref{sec:setup:forward}).

Already before the first version was released, a development branch was started
with the aim of adding more advanced features to \ARTS. At the time, treatment
of scattering and going beyond horizontally homogeneous atmospheres (1D), were
the main aims. This development resulted in a second main version \ARTS\
\citep{eriksson:arts2:11}, and further extensions have been made more recently.
\ARTS\ can today handle several observation techniques, as well as simulations
for other planets, but only aspects relevant for \smr\ are discussed below.
\smr\ measures thermal emission in a limb sounding geometry and, in this
context, the most important features of \ARTS\ are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The full polarisation state of radiation is described, by the Stokes
  formalism.
\item Atmospheric fields can be defined to vary in one dimension (1D;
  pressure), two dimensions (2D; pressure and angle along the orbit) or three
  dimensions (3D; pressure, latitude and longitude).
\item The planet's overall shape is spherical (also spheroidal allowed for 2D
  and 3D), there are no assumptions on a ``flat Earth''.
\item Gaseous absorption can be calculated based on several spectroscopic
  databases and a high number of absorption parameterisations.
\item The impact of the magnetic field on oxygen absorption due to the Zeeman
  effect can be considered \citep{larsson:zeema:14}.
\item Refraction can be considered.
\item There is extensive support to incorporate sensor characteristics.
\item The Jacobian can be obtained for a high number of atmospheric and sensor
  variables, in general with limited additional calculation time (only valid
  for non-scattering calculations).
\item Scattering can be incorporated by two different algorithms, denoted as DOIT
  \citep{emde:apoli:04} and MC \citep{davisetal:04}.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Access and documentation}
%
The \ARTS\ website has the address: \url{www.radiativetransfer.org}. Version 1
has been declared obsolete and is now limited to internal use, while download
instructions for recent public releases and the development branch are found
at \url{www.radiativetransfer.org/getarts}. Some external packages are needed,
generally or for special features, and these are listed at
\url{www.radiativetransfer.org/tools}.

To obtain an overview of \ARTS\ as a forward model, the primary reading should
be \citet{buehler:artst:05} and \citet{eriksson:arts2:11}. A more practically
inclined introduction to \ARTS\ is provided by the ``ARTS user guide'' (AUG).
Some background theory is found in ``ARTS theory'' (but this shall not be taken
as a complete treatment of atmospheric radiative transfer), and some parts of
\ARTS\ are even described by dedicated journal articles (see references
throughout this chapter). However, the core documentation of \ARTS\ is the
built-in description of workspace methods and variables. This is the main
information source for more experienced users and this documentation for the
present stable version can be browsed here:
\url{www.radiativetransfer.org/docserver-stable}. Finally, the best way to get
started with practical calculations is to copy and modify some of the test and
demonstration control files distributed with the software. For further details
and links to the ARTS user guide and other documents, see
\url{www.radiativetransfer.org/docs}.



\subsection{Validation and quality assurance}
%
\ARTS\ has been compared to other forward models by
\citet{melsheimer:inter:05}, \citet{buehler2006radiative} and
\citet{saunders07:_atmos_infrar_sound_airs_jgr}, as well as in other ways
lacking official documentation. A number of test cases has been defined for
\ARTS, targeting either a special part of \ARTS\ or a complete calculation of
some type. These tests are run at each new commit of code to the software
repository, in order to catch bugs and unexpected side-effects of code changes
as early as possible. As \ARTS\ is a very flexible tool, it is impossible to
design a complete set of tests, but standard applications of \ARTS\ should be
fairly well covered by the tests. Some of the tests include comparison to a
stored set of reference values, to test that not only the code runs but also
that the actual simulation results have not changed above some specified
tolerance. 

\lcomment{PE}{One of the present tests mimic \smr, but it should be updated and
  make use of reference values, to ensure safety when updating to a new \ARTS\
  version for the operational processing. Also the L2 processing chain should
  have an internal quality check. How?}


\section{Configuration used}
\label{sec:arts:config}

\subsection{\ARTS\ version and compilation options}
%
The processing chain contains a check that a specific version of \ARTS\ is
used. The version used presently is ARTS 2.3.?\todo{Add number later.}. \ARTS\
is written in C++, and a compilation for each platform is needed. The
\texttt{cmake} build system is used to set up the compilation of \ARTS. A
minimal version of \ARTS\ is created, using the following options:
\begin{verbatim}
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNO_NETCDF=1 -DNO_DOCSERVER=1 ..
\end{verbatim}
\lcomment{PE}{Finish this section later. During the development phase we should
just use latest version of the development branch. Later we should select a
specific version and add check in the code that exactly this version is used.
The executable should be minimal ARTS (no DISORT, T-Matrix ...). What level
optimisation should be used? Shall asserts be turned off?}


\subsection{Basic settings\todo{Add all missing section refs.}}
%
The atmosphere is set to be 1D. That is, atmospheric fields vary only as a
function of pressure, and are implicitly treated as constant in the latitude
and longitude dimensions. A 1D atmosphere implies a spherical reference geoid,
and the radius of the this geoid is set ?\todo{Fixed or as curvature radius?}.
The upper limit of the model atmosphere is in \ARTS\ defined by the lowest
value in the pressure grid. The range of this grid varies, see Sec.~?. The
lower limit of the atmosphere is determined by the planet's surface, and \ARTS\
demands that a surface is always defined. The altitude of the surface is for
these simulations set to ?\,km\todo{Add number}, and regarding radiative
properties it is set to behave as a blackbody.

It is possible to use a ``dummy'' surface for the following reason. Even if
data with (bore-sight) tangent altitudes below the tropopause are rejected, the
outer parts of the antenna pattern can result in propagation paths that
theoretically intersect with the surface, but the net impact of the surface is
still zero. This is the case due to the very high optical thickness of the
middle and lower troposphere at frequencies around 500\,GHz
\citep{ekstrom:first:07}. Even for tangent altitudes around 0\,km\ only
altitudes above $\sim$8\,km effectively contributes to measured radiance.

The atmosphere is assumed to not cause scattering, which is a valid assumption
for the wavelengths of \smr\ and tangent altitudes some kilometres above the
tropopause. 


\subsection{Gaseous absorption}
%
In lack of scattering and assuming LTE, the local radiative properties of the
atmosphere is solely determined by the absorption coefficient. \ARTS\ has two
main ways to calculate absorption, ``on-the-fly'' or by look-up tables, where
the latter option is by far the most efficient for simulations of \smr. That
is, molecular absorption cross-sections are pre-calculated and stored in
tables. One table is created for each frequency band. The tables contain
absorption cross-sections for combinations of pressure and temperature, and
final values are obtained by interpolation. It is throughout assumed that the
absorption cross-section does not vary with the mixing ratio of the gas, and
there is no ``non-linear'' species in the absorption table (this option is
required for water vapour in the lower troposphere).

\ARTS' absorption look-up table system is described in detail by
\citet{buehler:absor:11}. The spectroscopic data used to produce the look-up
tables are discussed in Sec.~?.


\subsection{Radiative transfer}
%
In general, the simulations mimic Eq.~\ref{eq:rteq}. Solving this equation
requires two main steps, to determine the propagation path and to perform the
integration along the found path. Refraction must be considered for \smr\
\citep{eriksson:studi:02}, which is achieved by a simple ray tracing scheme
(see AUG). The maximum step length of the ray tracing is set to ?\,km, which is
estimated to give a tangent point accuracy better than ?\,m for tangent
altitudes above 15\,km\todo{Perform test}. The propagation path used when
evaluating Eq.~\ref{eq:rteq} is defined by a set of points. A point is added at
each crossing of the path crosses with a pressure levels (that is, the
pressures defining the vertical grid). Additional points are inserted to ensure
that the distance along the path does not exceed an user defined threshold.
This threshold is set to ?\,km\todo{Create test for this.}. Only the first
element of the Stokes vector is calculated (remaining three elements are zero
for assumed conditions).


\subsection{118\,GHz}
%
The standard absorption and radiative transfer settings can not be used for
simulations targeting the 118\,GHz oxygen transition, as the Zeeman effect must
be considered. First of all, a matrix-vector version Eq.~\ref{eq:rteq} must be
applied \citep{larsson:zeema:14}, where the full Stokes vector is calculated.
Further, absorption must be calculated ``on-the-fly'' as the look-up table
approach does not handle polarised absorption. However, even with an extension
of the lookup-tables, the ``on-the-fly'' option would be to preferred as in
this case only the 118\,GHz transition itself must be considered (in contrast
to the 0.6\,mm frequency bands where hundredths of transitions must be summed
up) and a full calculation turns out to be faster than performing a
multi-dimensional interpolation.


\subsection{Sensor characteristics and calibration}
%
The impact of the various sensor responses is incorporated following
\citet{eriksson:06}. Also in this approach calculation time is saved by
performing pre-calculations, but, in contrast to the absorption tables, no
post-processing is needed. In short, the impact of the different sensor parts
is all linear operations and a ``response matrix'' representing the complete
receiver system can be determined. This calculation can be done before the
atmospheric radiative transfer has been performed, as long as the calculation
grids are set and the description of the sensor responses are at hand. The
response matrix obtained, \SnsMtr, is applied as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:H}
  \aMsrVct{\FrwMdl} = \SnsMtr\MpiVct
\end{equation}
where \aMsrVct{\FrwMdl}\ is the measurement vector produced by the forward
model and \MpiVct\ is all monochromatic pencil beam radiances compiled into a
vector. The vector \MpiVct\ must contain sufficient values to represent the
radiation field, as a function of frequency and zenith angle, with sufficient
accuracy. The methods setting up \SnsMtr\ assumes that both radiances and
sensor responses vary linear between the points were data are at
hand.\todo{Will the FillGrid method be used?}

The frequency and zenith angles for which radiative transfer is performed are
controlled by two calculation grids, as well as the sensor responses that are
incorporated in \SnsMtr, are discussed further in Sec.~?.



\section{Important aspects}
\label{sec:arts:aspects}
%
Some of the definitions applied in \ARTS\ have noticeable implications for the
L2 processing:
\begin{itemize}
\item The basic vertical coordinate in \ARTS\ is pressure. This has the
  consequence that the retrieval grid for atmospheric quantities is a set of
  pressures, and that retrieved profiles are functions of pressure.
\item With some exceptions of no concern here, \ARTS\ assumes data to vary
  linear between grid points. This applies to everything from sensor responses
  (such as the input antenna pattern file) to how retrieved data shall be
  interpreted. However, for the pressure dimension the variation is assumed to
  be linear in the logarithm of the pressure. That is, if a retrieved
  atmospheric profile shall be interpolated to another set of pressures, it
  should be done as (using Matlab notation):
\begin{verbatim}
  x_new = interp1( log(p_grid), x, log(p_grid_new) )
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|p_grid| is the original pressure grid, \verb|x| is the atmospheric
profile to be interpolated, and \verb|p_grid_new| is the pressure grid.
\item \lcomment{PE}{Should be more to add here}
\end{itemize}
