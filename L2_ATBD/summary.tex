\noindent
Some key issues that should be considered when examining or applying \smr\
L2 data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The retrievals assume a horizontally homogeneous (1D), non-scattering,
  atmosphere.
\item The main atmospheric vertical coordinate is pressure, i.e.\ \VMR\ and
  temperatures are retrieved as a function of pressure. The L2 data also
  contain an estimate of the geometrical altitudes
  matching the values of the profile, but this information shall be considered as
  secondary.
\item Retrieved profiles shall be considered as running average estimates of
  the true profile, with an averaging length roughly given by the vertical
  resolution.
\item Errors refer to the accuracy of running averages, and are only valid under
  the constraint of high measurement response. Using data with low measurement
  response requires consideration of smoothing effects.
\item Profile retrievals are best estimates at each pressure level. To obtain
  values at other pressure levels, apply a linear interpolation using the
  logarithm of pressure as independent variable.
\item A single geographical position is assigned to the L2 data. However, the
  data are far from point estimates in the horizontal direction, they represent
  averages of several 100\,km along the viewing direction of \smr, and not even
  the centre position of the averages is necessarily found at the stated
  position.
