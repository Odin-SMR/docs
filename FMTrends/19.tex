\subsubsection{Sideband paths}
\label{FM19:sbpath}
The sideband filter for FM~19 uses two more or less distinct values for the
sideband path length in equal measure: $-277.1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ and
$-278.1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$.
The leakage tendency is the same for both categories, and while a small
difference in the level of leakage could ostensibly be seen, it is much too
small to recommend any change in settings.

The tendency of the ``summer mode'' FM~119 appears to be similar to that of
FM~19, though the difference in leakage between the two main paths is more
pronounced.\todo{How much diff?}
There is, however, too little data to draw any conclusions
regarding long term trends.

\subsection{Correlation with FM 13}
\label{FM19:FM13:corr}
FM~19 consistently underperforms compared to FM~13 at altitudes of
$\sim70\,km$.
