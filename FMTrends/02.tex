\subsection{Sideband leakage}
The structure of the spectra of FM~2 is such that the sideband peaks often
overlap with the main peaks, and the sideband peaks that are distinct are
unfortunately localised in sub-bands of bad quality. It is therefore difficult
to draw any definite conclusions regarding the long term tendency of the
sideband leakage for this mode. However, the estimated sideband leakage seems
to be confined to 3--5\% (or more conservatively to 2--6\%), with no clear
tendency to either increase or decrease over time.
