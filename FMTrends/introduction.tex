\section{Aim and scope of this document}
\label{sec:aim}
The aim of this report is to give an overview of findings regarding long term
trends in the performance of the frequency modes of main interest to the
Odin/SMR Reprocessing Project. Particular emphasis is given to diagnosing the
sideband leakage. It is shown that the sideband appears to have been
increasing for many modes during the misson, though not always uniformly.
Furthermore, the changes in sideband leakage do not show any obvious
correlation with other parameters that have changed over time, such as the
onboard temperature.

This document is to be seen as a follow-up study to the more thorough
Ref.~\cite{postlaunch:2006}.

\section{Document structure}

This document is organized as follows:
After this introduction follows sections for the several frequency modes that
have been investiagted. These have been group into chapters by their main
species of interest. This is followed by a brief summary of findings, and an
appendix with general trends not specifict to any particular frequency mode.
Finally there is a list of changes and additions that have been made to the
document.
