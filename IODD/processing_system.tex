\section{Design of the Level2 processing system}

The processing system consists of three parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Job Service: An api that keeps track of which jobs that are available.
\item Workers: Fetch jobs from the job service, send them to the Level2
  Processor and notify the job service when the jobs are done.
\item Level2 Processor: Fetches the dynamic input data from the odin api
  and sends the resulting level2 data to the odin api.
\end{itemize}
