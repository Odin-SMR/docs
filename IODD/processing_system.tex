\section{Design of the Level2 processing system}

The processing system consists of three parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Job Service: An api that keeps track of which jobs that are available.
\item Workers: Fetch jobs from the job service, send them to the Level2
  Processor and notify the job service when the jobs are done.
\item Level2 Processor: Fetches the dynamic input data from the odin api
  and sends the resulting level2 data to the odin api.
\end{itemize}

The inter-component communication is realised by exchanging JSON objects
through a authenticated REST API over \emph{https} (Sect.~\ref{api}). This
implies that the involved pool of workers do not need to be in the same
network, neither as each other, nor as the server. This makes the processing
system flexible and easily scalable and re-scalable on demand, as the needs for
processing power changes. The main bottle neck is the access to the database,
which is therefore located on a dedicated server.
