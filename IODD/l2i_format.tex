\begin{itemize}
  \item BlineOffset (\emph{2-D array of doubles}): Retrieved ``baseline''
    offsets, that differ for each used spectrum and each autocorrelate sub-module
  \item ChannelsID (\emph{array of doubles}): Channel identifier that describes
    which channels that were used in the retrieval [-]. More exactly it
    describes the location of the sorted channels in the original unsorted
    spectra
  \item FitSpectrum (\emph{2-D array of doubles}): Fitted spectrum [K]
  \item FreqMode (\emph{int}): \smr\ frequency mode of the observation
  \item FreqOffset (\emph{double}): Retrieved frequency offset of the LO frequency [Hz]
  \item InvMode (\emph{string}): Inversion mode
  \item L1bQuality (\emph{int}): Quality of L1b data used
  \item LOFreq (\emph{array of doubles}): LO frequency of each each spectrum of
    the scan [Hz]
  \item MinLmFactor (\emph{double}): The minimum value of the Levenberg -
    Marquardt factor during the OEM iterations [-]
  \item PointOffset (\emph{double}): Retrieved pointing offset in degrees
  \item Residual (\emph{double}): The difference between the spectra matching
    retrieved state and used measurement spectra ([K])
  \item STW (\emph{array of doubles}): Satellite time word of each spectrum
    used in the retrieval
  \item ScanID (\emph{int}): Satellite time word scan identifier
